	<!--The difference between absolute positioning and relative positioning is that
		relative positioning moves the boxes in relation to where it will normally be, 
		therefore, the co-ordinates of the Top and Left given in the css code above, 
		will apply to where positionning it to where it will normally be, not
		from the top left of the canvas-->

	<!--Whearas Absolute positioning moves the boxes from the top left of your screen-->

	<!--							**Note**
		However, the problem with this positioning is that the gap where the box should
		be is left empty, so there is a whole/gap-->
