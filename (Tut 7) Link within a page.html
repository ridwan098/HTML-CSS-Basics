<h1><a name = "Posting"></a>Posting in the wrong place</h1>
<p>You are not to post the same thread twice, be it in the same section or in two separate sections. Of course we understand that you can accidentally hit the submit button twice, but posting a topic a second time just to give it more attention will result in one of the topics being deleted or locked dependent on the situation. If one of the topics has already received helpful replies, the other topic will be locked, linking to the topic that will remain open. Accidental double posts will be deleted without any further consequences for the user.
This also goes for posting posts in the wrong topics. Post topics and posts in the correct place. This means questions about PHP go in the PHP forum, and not the General Chat section.</p>

<h1><a name = "Copyright"></a>Copyright</h1>
<p>You are not allowed to post anything that you didn't make if you do not have the permission to do so. For example, if there's a news item you want to discuss, don't copy/paste the entire article, but link to it, and then quite small portions of the article that you want to discuss specifically. This is because those articles are protected by copyright. Copyright infringements are the worst kind of violations, as they may have an effect on the entire site, in the sense that it can be taken down! So you should take this very seriously. In similar vein, we will act on copyright infringements very seriously and severely.
Of course this isn't limited to just written works. Visual works, software, code and other creations are often also protected.</p>

<h1><a name = "Advertising/ Spam"></a>Advertising/ Spam</h1>
<p>Advertising web sites or products that you are in some way affiliated with is not allowed. This goes for any and all advertisements. Advertisements will be removed instantly, no exceptions. You can, however, share with the rest of the forum something you have created as long as your main purpose of sharing is not for financial gain.</p>

<h1><a name = "Pointless Posting"></a>Pointless Posting</h1>
<p>Don't post pointless topics or replies. If they don't contribute, don't post.</p>

<h1><a name = "Illegal Things"></a>Illegal things</h1>
<p>Don't discuss and/or post illegal activities or content. This includes hacks, cracks, or anything else that's law breaking in any way.</p>

<h1><a name = "Important Personal Advice"></a>Important personal advice</h1>
<p>Is anything really sensitive going on in your life? Do you need heavy medication? Do you want to commit suicide? Anything else? If so, please don't discuss that here. There are people out there who are trained to help you deal with those kind of things. Talking about here will only get you in deeper trouble, most likely, since you will rarely encounter a professional here who can help you.</p>
