	<!--Css works by looking at the edit that you put most recently (last). Therefore to overide
		a style, you put the style after the first one-->
	<!--This may be because you want to do something different to a particular webpage
		that wouldnt be the same to others.-->
	<!--The general rule of thumb is that you put your css file above and then use your 
		style tag in the head to modify things to that particular webpage-->

	<!--So in the example above, the Style tag overrides the external style sheet
		as the HEADERS are lightblue instead of green-->

	<!--if the linked css file was the most recent rule, then the headers will be green-->

	<!--								**NOTE**	
		You never actually want to put the style tags above the external style sheet
			-->
