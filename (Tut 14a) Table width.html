<!--To adjust the width of a table, 
you use the keyword "width"-->

<!-- This changes how wide the table is, 
measured in pixels, so for example inputting
500 would result in it being 500 pixels wide.-->

<!--**KEY POINT**--

Using the percentages means that the width would be in porportion
to how wide your website is on the browser.

for example, width = "100%"
would result in the table being as wide as the total width of 
the webpage on the browser.

this means that the table would be dynamic as the 100% width
would depend on whether the browser was i.e minimised or maximised
and would therefore adapt to whatever the size and remain 100% the 
width
