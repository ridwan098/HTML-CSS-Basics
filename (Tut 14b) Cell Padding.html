Cellpadding.
-------------
To use call padding, you use the keyword cell padding.
This is used to create a gap between the table data and table wall--
so essentially, a gap between the texts and the wall/border-->

<!--This is also measured in pixels so the example below, 
will give you 10 pixels in space.-->

<table border = "2" cellpadding = "10">
	<tr>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Reason</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cat People</td>
		<td>17 cats is just too many</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Loud People</td>
		<td>Sure, turn that music up, its only 3am</td>
	</tr>
